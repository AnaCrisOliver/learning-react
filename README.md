# Learning React.JS 👩‍💻 ⚛️

This is where I'm keeping my ReactJS projects while I'm learning more about this amazing JavaScript library.

## Here you'll se:
 - 🍿 **Netflix website**: my first react project, a front-end design inspired on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) official website. You can find that [here](https://github.com/AnaCrisOliver/learning-react/tree/master/first-project
).

## What do I use to create my projects?
 - A DELL inspiron computer with an Intel® Core™ i5-10210U CPU @ 1.60GHz × 8 processor, 8gb RAM
 - Ubuntu 18.04.5
 - Visual Studio Code
 - NPM
 - NodeJS
 - Git and GitHub  :octocat:

## Running React.JS apps ⚙️
If you don't know how to run a ReactJS project, follow this short tutorial bellow: </br>

 - Make shure you have [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer, and if you don't, there are many YouTube tutorials out there, as [this one for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLDlAN8Gek) or [this one for Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLDlAN8Gek). My advice here is to install using NPM so you can control which nodeJS version you want.

 - Clone this repository: </br>
**$ git clone https://github.com/AnaCrisOliver/learning-react.git**

 - Go to the project folder you want: </br>
**$ cd learning-react/first-project**

 - Install npm dependencies: </br>
**$ npm install**

 - Run the app: </br>
**$ npm start**

Then, the server will open a tab on a browser using port 3000 (probably). Enjoy!

## **This is a work-in-progress repository, so come back soon for more projects! 🔧👾** ##
