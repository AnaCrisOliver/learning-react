# Netflix Website Project üçø

This is officially my first react project, a simple front-end design based on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) official website. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBweoUiMsDg) from another developer inspired me (thank you so much, [Bonieky Lacerda!](https://github.com/bonieky)) to create this app. This was an interesting project to make because it allowed me to learn more about the basics of React Library, JSX syntax and how to integrate an API to an APP. I hope that in the future I can create more fancy Apps by myself, but let's stick to the basis right now, ok?

I used an amazing API to fill the catalog of movies and tv shows: [Tmdb](https://www.themoviedb.org/). And good news, this API is free, so you can use it without inserting your credidt card info.

The very first version of this project is basic and my ideia is to release new versions over the time, adding some cool features.

### **If you don't know how to run a ReactJS project, then follow this short tutorial bellow:**

 - Make shure you have [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer, and if you don't, there are many YouTube tutorials out there, as [this one for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLDlAN8Gek) or [this one for Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRLDlAN8Gek). My advice here is to install using NPM so you can control which nodeJS version you want.

 - Clone this repository: </br>
    **$ git clone https://github.com/AnaCrisOliver/learning-react.git**

 - Go to the project folder: </br>
    **$ cd learning-react/first-project**

 - Install npm dependencies: </br>
    **$ npm install**
 
 - Run the app: </br>
    **$ npm start**

Then, the server will open a tab on a browser using port 3000 (probably).
Enjoy! üçø
